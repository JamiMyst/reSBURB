# reSBURB
This is a remake/overhaul of the [Realistic Sburb Sim (RSBURBS 2.0)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/9nvd51/rsburbs_update_20/) by [u/osm70](https://www.reddit.com/user/osm70).

> This program is a simulator of a game called SBURB. You might know that game from Homestuck.

> If you know Homestuck, you should know that SBURB is very unfair. Many game sessions are simply impossible to win. It’s not the fault of the players, though. Those session were unwinnable from the start. Or sometimes, there’s a session that could be won… in theory, but some external force from outside the game messes it up.

> Is that a bad design? Yes, but it’s not my fault. I am just showcasing how unfair SBURB is.
